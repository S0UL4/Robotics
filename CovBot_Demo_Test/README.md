# CoviBot DEMO TEST
This Robot :robot:	 is programmed to detect people who are not wearing their mask during this pandemic ( Covid19) ! .
He Keeps tracking you with his annoying beep sound until you wear your mask ! it can be very useful nowadays to preventing the Spread of Cronoa Virus.
This is a Test demo of the project and not yet completed ! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:	
My first test of the project is based on :
* Tensorflow
* OpenCV
* Arduino Uno
* Bluetooth Module ( for the communication between the computer and the arduino )

I'm still working on it. :star_struck:
