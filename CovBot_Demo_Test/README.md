This Robot :robot:	 is programmed to detect people who are not wearing their mask during this pandemic ( Covid19) ! .
He Keeps tracking you with his annoying beep sound until you wear your mask ! it can be very useful nowadays to prevent the Spread of corona Virus.

My first test of the project is based on Computer vision 

I'm still working on it . :star_struck:
