# CoviBot DEMO TEST
This Robot :robot:	 is programmed to detect people who are not wearing their mask during this pandemic ( Covid19) ! .
He Keeps tracking you with his annoying beep sound until you wear your mask ! it can be very useful nowadays to prevent the Spread of corona Virus.
This is a Test demo of the project and not yet completed ! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:	

My first test of the project is based on :

* OpenCV

* Tensorflow 

* Arduino uno

* HC-05 Bluetooth module ( to send data from my computer to the arduino )

* 2 Servo motors ( X & Y axis )

Maybe i'll keep working on it to update & add more features and move everything to a Raspberry Pi.. . :star_struck:
